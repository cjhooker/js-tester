# js-tester

Allows you to test a piece of JavaScript code and determine:

1. Whether a certain language element (e.g. If Statement or For Statement) is used
2. Whether a certain language element is NOT used anywhere
3. Whether a certain set of nested language elements are used (e.g. an If inside a For inside a Try)
